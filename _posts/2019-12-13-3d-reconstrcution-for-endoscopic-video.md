description: This blog describes my experience with 3D reconstruction of stereo endoscopic video, including ARAMIS and MICCAI 2019 EndoVis Challenge (SCARED sub-challenge). We have tried traditional algorithms that optimizes for speed and efficiency, which is implemented in ARAMIS, and also novel deep-learning-based methods to tackle the SCARED challenge.
