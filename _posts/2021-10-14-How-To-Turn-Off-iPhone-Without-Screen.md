Typically, the iPhone can be powered off by holding the power button and volumn up button. Then you can slide the bar on the screen to power it off.

But what if the screen is freezing unresponsive. If you keep holding power button and volum up button, instead of power off the phone, it is going to send emergency SMS to some number. Thuat is not what you want.

Here is what you can do:

- Make sure screen if off
- Hit the volumn up button
- Then Volum Down button
- Then holding the power button until the device restarts

The last three steps needs to be pretty fluid. In this way, the device will be restarting without touching the screen.

Hope it helps!
