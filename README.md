Time to write something down

Tried few other themes, since Github pages does NOT support the jerkyII-tags or jerkyII-archives. It made the usage of tags and categories much more complicated.

Using this theme, I am able to manually create these page for tags. Better than nothing

### Theme

The theme is forked from [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
and [qian](https://github.com/qian256)
